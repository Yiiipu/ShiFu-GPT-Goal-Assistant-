# ShiFu-GPT-Goal-Assistant-

Key Features:
1. SMART Goal Identification: AI advisor listens to your complaints about life and helps you identify a SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound) goal that addresses your concerns.
2. Manageable Plan Creation: AI collaborates with you to create a plan that is easy to follow and manage. It helps you break down your goal into smaller steps, ensuring that you have a clear roadmap to success.
3. Task Management: The app generates small and executable tasks that fit into your daily routine. With these tasks in your task management window, you can easily monitor your progress and stay on track.
4. Periodic Reflection and Consultation: ShiFu supports periodic reflection, allowing you to check your progress, consult with your AI advisor about any issues you encounter along the way, and adjust your plan as needed (upcoming feature). In addition, you will receive encouragement and motivation occasionally from your AI advisor to keep you going.
Notice: As an early-stage app, ShiFu v1.0 delivers all the key concepts in a minimal, workable form and a simple UI. Iâ€™m not a full time developer and there are bugs. I plan on bi-weekly updates in the early stage to provide better experience.

It is completely free. However, it uses 3.5 turbo, and you need to enter api key in settings before chatting.
